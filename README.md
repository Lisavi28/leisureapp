## User story

As a person who enjoys living new and gratifying experiences. I want to find events and festivals near me. So that I can better spend my free time.

Although sometimes I also enjoy watching a good movie in the comfort of home, I would like to know on which platform I can find my best option.

Given an interactive application When I enter my location Then I am presented with a menu with types of activities, current and future events When I select an activity Then they introduce me and the place, time and price. When sometimes I seek to enjoy my free time at home given an app with form inputs allows me to search for movies then I am presented with different genres of movies to choose from giving me the platform where I can enjoy it.
